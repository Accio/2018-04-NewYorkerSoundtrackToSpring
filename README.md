According to the New Yorker, [the cover was made by the cartoonist Tom Gauld](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cover-story/cover-story-2018-04-16). I was so much inspired by the idea that I learned to use the `MuseScore2` software to make the note so that I can hear them. 

Feel free to use my file under the GPL-3 license. In the link above, you can find an interative version of the cover, which can play the melodies if you hover the mouse above the notes. Another great idea!
